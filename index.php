        <h2>Why is There So Little?</h2>
        <p>
            Now, you may be asking why there isn't much on this site yet? And you'd 
            be right to ask that, that's where this section comes in. Since 
            Camping4You is still relatively new and a small business, we haven't 
            grown much yet and are still building our business. So we just ask that 
            you bear with us and perhaps maybe even donate to aid in our growth, of 
            course a donation is not required to make an account with us, but it 
            would be greatly appreciated in our early days of operation. Regardless, 
            we'll try our best to stay here and work to provide a great source of 
            all things camping for those who seek it out, from camping supplies to 
            camping tips.
